The small but mighty Nybble Q has these fantastic features:

* Respond to voice commands, performing over **35 predefined actions** such as sit, push-up, and wash-face with high-performance, lifelike movements. You can switch between English and Chinese using simple voice commands.
* It can be programmed with **ten more customized voice commands** performing skills you create. The voice command can be any sound, so it's **free from languages**.
* Support **Petoi** **Coding Blocks(block-based Scratch-like), C++, and Python**.
* **Free** [C++](https://www.petoi.com/pages/free-cplusplus-quadruped-robotics-curriculum) and [Petoi Coding Blocks](https://www.petoi.com/pages/free-quadruped-robotics-curriculum-scratch-coding)(block-based Scratch-like) **curriculums**.
* Equipped with BiBoard V1, a high-performance **ESP32** development board supporting additional modules for robotics/AI/IoT applications.
